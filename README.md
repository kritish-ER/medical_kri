## 📄 Abstract

Early detection of diseases plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based disease prediction system that analyzes patient health parameters to predict the likelihood of a disease. Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate and reliable approach. The system aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing a data-driven decision support tool.

## 1. Introduction

Healthcare systems generate a large volume of medical data that can be effectively utilized using machine learning techniques. Traditional diagnosis methods depend heavily on manual interpretation, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze healthcare data and predict diseases at an early stage.

## 2. Problem Statement

Manual diagnosis of diseases based on multiple clinical parameters is complex and may lead to delayed or inaccurate results. There is a need for an automated system that can efficiently analyze patient data and provide accurate disease predictions.

## 3. Objectives

- To analyze healthcare datasets for disease prediction
- To implement multiple machine learning models
- To compare model performance using evaluation metrics
- To build a reliable prediction system for healthcare applications

## 4. Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project consists of patient health parameters such as:

- **Age**
- **Gender** 
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Cholesterol Level**
- **Blood Sugar**
- **Symptoms indicators**

The dataset was obtained from publicly available healthcare repositories/synthetic data sources.
